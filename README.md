## What'd I'd like to improve on...

1. There is overlap in the bitbucket/github API (especially aggragate). Would probably want to clean that up and make it more DRY
2. Tests are not complete ~ need more comperhensive testing around API responses
3. Handle failure cases, currently this works or a 500 is thrown
